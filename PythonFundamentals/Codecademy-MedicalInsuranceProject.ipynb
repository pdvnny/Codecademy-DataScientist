    "This mini-project is meant to be a demonstration of some fundamentals of Python. I am trying to complete the data scientist path on Codecademy and practice Python, so I have gone back to some content that I have learned already.\n",

    "This is the first mini-project that I have previously learned how to do and am now reviewing.\n",

    "### Assignment Description\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Suppose you are a medical professional curious about how certain factors contribute to medical insurance costs. Using a formula that estimates a person's yearly insurance costs, you will investigate how different factors such as age, sex, BMI, etc. affect the prediction.\"  \n",
    "  \n",
    "General Note: The assignment was meant to be basic. Some of the concepts mentioned could be far more elaborate, but this was just an introductory-level lesson."
