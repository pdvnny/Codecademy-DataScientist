# Project: US Medical Insurance

## Description

This particular directory contains files for a cumulative project that is meant to demonstrate the material I learned on Codecademy.com.

I wanted to focus data visualization and analysis with this assignment, so I decided to stick with the data provided for the assignment, which was already cleaned and prepared.

I decided to practice the following things in Python with this project:

* Reading from CSV file
* Basic Regression (sci-kit learn linear regression)
* Data Visualization
* Principle Component Analysis
