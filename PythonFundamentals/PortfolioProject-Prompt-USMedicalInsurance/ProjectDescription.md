# Codecademy - Python Fundamentals - Portfolio Project

### Information about what a "portfolio project" is meant to be on Codecademy

## What is a Porfoltio Project?
* build a project in your own development environment and publish to the web

## How do Portolio Projects Work?
* Codecademy provides high-level tasks to guide project
* I am responsible for deciding how to implement tasks in my code

## PROJECT PROMPT: U.S. Medical Insurance Costs
I didn't have to chose this prompt, but it was the one suggested by Codecademy

### Project Overview

For this project, you will be investigating a medical insurance costs dataset in a `.csv` file using the Python skills that you have developed. This dataset and its paramters will seem familiar if you have done any fo the previous Python projects in the data science path.

However, you are now tasked with working with the actual information in the dataset and performing your own independent analysis on real-world data! We will not be providing step-by-step instructions on what to do, but we will provide you with a framework to structure your exploration and analysis.

### Project Objectives

* Work locally on your own computer
* Import a dataset into your program
* Analyze a dataset by building out function or class methods
* Use libraries to assist in your analysis
* Optional: Document and organize your findings
* Optional: Make predictions about a dataset's features based on your own findings
