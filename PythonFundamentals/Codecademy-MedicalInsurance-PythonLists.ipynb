To review the basics of Syntax, Varible Types, Functions, Control Flow, and Python lists, I have been working on a single project related to \"Medical Insurance.\" I have started this new script to keep neat work spaces.\n",

    "\n",
    "You will apply your new knowledge of Python Lists to store insurance cost data in a list as well as compare estimated insurance costs to actual insurance costs.\""
