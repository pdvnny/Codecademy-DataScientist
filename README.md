# Codecademy-DataScientist
 Projects and assignments that I completed while learning Python and data science on Codecademy.

# What this repo is...

I practice coding in Python on Codecademy whenever I have free time. A lot of my work at Boston University is in C++, so it has been helpful to keep practicing Python via Codecademy at the same time. The work in this repo is projects that I completed as part of the lessons on that site.

The directories in this repo are organized by over-arching topics (e.g., Getting Started with Data Science & Python Fundamentals). The specific topics of each file are identified at the top each of script for the most part.

### Outline of Topics in each directory
* Getting Started with Data Science:
  * *will update when I get a chance*
* Python Fundamentals:
  * *will update when I get a chance*

# Sample Work

From [Medical Insurance Portfolio Project](https://github.com/pdvnny/Codecademy-DataScientist/tree/master/PythonFundamentals/PortfolioProject-Prompt-USMedicalInsurance):

*Whoops...There is no background for the figure below so you cannot see the labels and titles on this figure. I'll fix this soon.*

# Opening work in this repo

For the most part, everything in this repo was completed in Jupyter Notebooks. Any environment that can open Jupyter Notebooks should not have trouble opening and running these files.

Additional modules needed for some scripts:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Sklearn
* SciPy
* Matplotlib

1/14/2022 - In *PythonFundamentals/PortfolioProject-Prompt-USMedicalInsurance*, the Jupyter Notebook containing the core of my work for this "portfolio project" is the only file that requires non-standard Python modules.
